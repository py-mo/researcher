## ⚡️ Motivation

As a CS student with a passion for AI and deep learning, I often read papers and documents. Traditional search is frustrating and inefficient when I need **context-aware** understanding or exploration.

**Goal:** Build a fast, local tool that helps me extract knowledge from documents through semantic search and LLMs.

## Why Paused

Main reason: Focus has shifted to a [Hybrid-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation](https://github.com/py-mo/Hybrid-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation) that explores retrieval quality and advanced tooling.  
This project is on hold until insights and components from that work can be merged back.
